Python Distributed Hardware Server Framework
============================================

This project provides a general python-based framework for writing a Distributed Hardware Servers (DHS).

Description
===========

This code base will provide the necessary functionality to communicate with DCSS and be configurable for different peices of hardware. For example it could be configured to control hardware connected to a Raspberry Pi, run some python scripts, run specific DCSS operations that need to access web resources or serial-connected devices.
